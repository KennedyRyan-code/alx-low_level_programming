# C - malloc, free
## General
* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is malloc and free and how to use them
* Why and when use malloc
* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

**Tasks**
0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
*Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.*

1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
*Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.*

2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
*Write a function that concatenates two strings.*

* The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated
* if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
* The function should return NULL on failure*

3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
*Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.*

* Each element of the grid should be initialized to 0
* The function should return NULL on failure
* If width or height is 0 or negative, return NULL

4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
*Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.*
